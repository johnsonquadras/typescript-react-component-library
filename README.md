# Blog Component Library
#### TODO
1) Add stories and tests for all gatsby components
2) Add semantic less
3) Define proper build pattern for library https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react/blob/master/src/index.js
4) Change public to docs for github + create a generic page
5) Figure out story book build location
6) Let's do readme with how we did this and what not... similar to gatbsy project
7) Setup TS lint and ts config to be stricter and ideal for production (auto fix issues)


More clearly define how the CSS and SCSS builds... maybe rename those steps

I'd like to add a some pre-commit steps.
